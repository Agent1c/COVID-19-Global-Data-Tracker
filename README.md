# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using the `Covid Data.csv` dataset. The notebook guides you through data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization for selected countries (Kenya, USA, India). Key metrics such as cases, deaths, and vaccinations are explored to provide insights into the pandemic's progression and impact.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Import libraries, load the dataset, inspect structure, and identify missing values.
- **Data Cleaning:** Filter for countries of interest, handle missing values, and ensure correct data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends in cases and deaths, compare countries, and calculate death rates.
- **Vaccination Progress:** Analyze and visualize vaccination rollouts and compare vaccination rates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

1. Place `Covid Data.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the sections to explore and visualize COVID-19 data.
